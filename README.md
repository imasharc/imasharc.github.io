This repository contains the source code for my personal website.
In order to make the website load fast and take minimum space it is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
No framework. No external library. No overhead.
It may change in the future, but now...I don't need it

## Features

## Structure

The website is structured into four main sections:

- `experience.html`: This page contains details about my professional experience.
- `projects.html`: This page showcases my projects.
